Weather Data Collection Bot

Overview

The Weather Data Collection Bot is a Python-based application designed for automated collection, analysis, and visualization of weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project aims to facilitate weather data monitoring by 
providing tools to fetch, clean, analyze, and visualize weather information for multiple cities.

Key Features

Automated Data Collection: Fetches current weather data for multiple cities.
Data Cleaning: Processes raw data to remove inconsistencies.
Data Analysis: Analyzes weather trends and generates statistics.
Interactive Visualization: Provides a dashboard to visualize weather data.
Automation: Includes scripts to automate the entire data handling workflow.

Project Background

The Weather Data Collection Bot is designed to automate the process of gathering weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The collected data is then processed to ensure accuracy, analyzed to identify trends, and visualized for 
insights. This project is ideal for individuals or organizations interested in weather data analysis and visualization.

Installation and Setup

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
A virtual environment tool (e.g., venv or virtualenv)
An API Key from OpenWeatherMap
Steps to Install
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/adams20023/weather-data-collection-bot.git
cd weather-data-collection-bot
Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

plaintext
Copy code
API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
Run the Data Collection Script
Execute the data collection script to fetch weather data:

bash
Copy code
python data_collection.py
Run Other Scripts
Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data with data_analysis.py:
bash
Copy code
python data_analysis.py
Data Cleaning: Clean the data with data_cleaning.py:
bash
Copy code
python data_cleaning.py
Interactive Dashboard: Generate the interactive dashboard with interactive_dashboard.py:
bash
Copy code
python interactive_dashboard.py
Automation: Run all scripts sequentially with run_all.sh:
bash
Copy code
bash run_all.sh
Usage

Data Collection
data_collection.py retrieves weather data for a list of cities from the OpenWeatherMap API and saves it to output_data.csv. The data includes:

Temperature
Weather Description
Humidity
Wind Speed
Pressure
Data Analysis
data_analysis.py processes and analyzes the collected weather data to generate statistical insights and trends. This script is used to:

Compute average temperatures
Identify weather patterns
Generate summary statistics
Data Cleaning
data_cleaning.py ensures the accuracy and consistency of the collected data by:

Removing duplicate entries
Handling missing values
Correcting data inconsistencies
Interactive Dashboard
interactive_dashboard.py creates an interactive dashboard for visualizing weather data. This includes:

Temperature trends
Weather condition distributions
Interactive charts and graphs
Automation
run_all.sh automates the execution of all necessary scripts in sequence:

data_collection.py – Fetches new data
data_cleaning.py – Cleans the fetched data
data_analysis.py – Analyzes the cleaned data
interactive_dashboard.py – Updates the visualization
